# Generate class files:
javac -sourcepath ..\assignments\*\ *.java

# Run Test Harness with a specific assignment:
java -cp ..\assignments\one\;.\ Harness

#==========================================

The output from the test harness is intentionally hard to read (for humans).

For a computer, it's easy to read and has a very programmatic feel to it.
