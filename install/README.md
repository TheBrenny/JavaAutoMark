This folder will contain all the code and templates to install this tool into the app config settings.

Things that we need to think about when creating the install pages and methods:
 - SQL URL
 - Admin account details
 - Location of assignment uploads
   - Amazon S3 credentials, OR
   - Google Cloud Storage creds
   - https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/SMCloudStore -- Use this to upload files, or write our own custom multi-service manager thing.
 - uuhhm... and more?
